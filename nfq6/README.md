# nfq6
experimental vehicle for IPv6 libnetfilter\_queue helper functions and
documentation  
nfq6 needs a recent version of libnetfilter\_queue, usually from the
[libnetfilter\_queue Git repository](https://git.netfilter.org/libnetfilter\_queue).  
In addition, nfq6 may need uncommited libnetfilter\_queue patches which have
been posted to mailing list _netfilter-devel@vger.kernel.org_ or you can get
them from the
[mailing list archive](http://www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter-devel/)
(in the browser, search for _libnetfilter\_queue_).  
At time of writing (2019-11-29 12:37:15 +1100), you need
[this one](https://www.spinics.net/lists/netfilter-devel/msg64152.html).
